Hello darkness, my old friend 
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone, narrow streets of cobblestone
A'neath the halo of a street lamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence
